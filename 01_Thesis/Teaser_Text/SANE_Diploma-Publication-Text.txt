Wie gestalten wir Freiräume mit öffentlichem Charakter? Wie gehen wir mit Verkehr, Platz und Interaktion in Quartierstrassen um? Mit der “Werkstadt” kann jeder an der Umgestaltung teilhaben — Was wollt ihr auf der Strasse machen?

Abstract IAD DE
This thesis explores the issue of unproductive car infrastructure and the potential for reclaiming public space in cities. By analysing the historical context of urbanisation and the politics involved in planning, the authors argue that the street as public space has been decaying into car centric infrastructure, resulting in loss of live quality and neighbourhood communities. The thesis proposes a hypothesis and research questions to explore the possibilities of reclaiming public space from parking infrastructure, offering a development toolkit for a more “public” and community-driven urban environment. Through a methodology that includes strollology, interviews, research through prototyping, and a co-design process with residents, the authors examine the potential of self-initiated planning, occupation and repurposing of brownfields and unproductive spaces to give expression to imagined ideas and enable community building. The thesis presents its methodology of interactive prototyping on location as possible solution improve city planning processes. It outlines different possibilities of activism to improve and advertise change in a grass-roots movement style. In further development of the idea, it proposes more emphasis on the community surrounding the action, using digital and analog “traces” to enable discovery and more permanent discussion of the matter.
